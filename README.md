TOPIC: Using Machine Learning Models to Predict At-Risk Students at Various Stages of Course Progress for Early Intervention

Objectives:

1.Early Prediction of At-Risk Students:
can be achieved by building models that predict students at high risk of dropping out based on course engagement data. By identifying at-risk students early, instructors can focus on timely intervention to improve retention rates.

2.Incorporating NLP for Feedback Analysis:
We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze student feedback. This will allow instructors to gain insights into areas where students are struggling or require additional support, thus enabling a more personalized approach to teaching.

The study proposes a predictive model using various ML algorithms to identify at-risk students early in online courses. It highlights the need for timely interventions to improve student engagement and prevent dropouts
Integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based feedback system that enables students to provide continuous, structured feedback to teachers along with an assessment of its novelty:

The current section on intervention focuses on influencing studentsâ€™ behavior through triggers. Adding a feedback loop would complement this by enabling instructors to adapt their teaching strategies based on student input, creating a more personalized and supportive learning environment.

Objective of Feedback System:
To collect qualitative and quantitative feedback from students throughout the course using NLP to analyze sentiments, key concerns, and suggestions.

Components:
1. Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling: Utilize NLP models like BERT or LDA to extract sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) and key topics (engagement, difficulty, content delivery).
2. Actionable Insights for Instructors: Provide summarized insights to instructors highlighting areas needing improvement (e.g., pacing, clarity, assessment fairness).
3. Adaptive Feedback Loop: Link insights to personalized instructor responses or course adjustments to demonstrate responsiveness to feedback.


Recent trends in educational data mining and online learning analytics research, integrating an NLP-based feedback mechanism for instructors' adaptation is likely a novel contribution due to the following:

1. Lack of Emphasis on Instructor Feedback: The provided paper and most similar studies primarily focus on predicting student outcomes and providing feedback to students. They do not address a reciprocal feedback mechanism for instructors.
2. Limited Use of NLP in Learning Analytics: While NLP is used in some educational settings, its use for dynamic instructor feedback  in conjunction with early dropout prediction models remains underexplored.
3. Two-Way Interaction: Your approach focuses on bidirectional learning analytics, where both student learning and instructor teaching are dynamically enhanced.

4. Unique Value Proposition
Adding this component would:
- Enhance the personalization of interventions for students.
- Empower instructors to adjust teaching strategies in real time based on objective, sentiment-driven student feedback.
- Potentially lower dropout rates by addressing instructor effectiveness alongside student engagement.

5. Recommendation for Making the Paper Unique
To further establish uniqueness:
- How feedback analytics influence teaching strategies in real time.
- Incorporating  comparative studies on the effectiveness of teacher feedback in reducing dropouts compared to traditional interventions.
- Including technical details on NLP algorithms used (e.g., sentiment analysis, clustering methods) and their implementation specifics for early detection.
